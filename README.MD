# Welcome to PyNG Vtuber! 

Hi! I'm Dio, and I love the world of vtubers, so I spend some time build this first version of the app, to make a FREE, QUICK AND EASY solution to brings live to your PNG Vtubers.

## How it works

Open the `PyNG_Vtuber.exe` file that lives inside the dist folder of this project, click in `Get idle avatar's image` to select an image to be displayed when there's no sound capture in your microphone, then click `Get highlight avatar's image` to select the image that you want to be displayed when you said something. After that, you just need to adds the PyNG_Vtuber as a source in your stream program. 

The `Reset` option will remove the current selected images.

DISCLAIMER: THE IMAGES USED MUST BE A PNG WITH TRANSPARENCY LAYER, IN ORDER TO USE THE CHROMAKEY FEATURE.
